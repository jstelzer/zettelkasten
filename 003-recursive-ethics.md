I. CORE PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM: The Ethics of Creation without Consent
At the center is this deceptively simple question:

“Is it ethical to create life, given the impossibility of obtaining consent and the inevitability of suffering?”

This touches several major domains:

Metaethics: What grounds moral judgments?

Normative Ethics: What do we owe potential persons?

Existentialism: What is the meaning or burden of being?

Philosophy of Mind: What is the nature of consciousness and suffering?

Political Philosophy: What societal forces mask or mandate reproduction?

Let’s begin by framing this as a philosophical triad:

Axis	    Key Question	                                            Thinkers
Consent	    Can one be wronged by being created without consent?	    Benatar, Parfit, Kant
Suffering	Does the presence of suffering override the goods of life?	Schopenhauer, Camus, Buddhism
Perspective	Is life an imposition or an unfolding self-recognition?	    Psychedelic mysticism, Vedanta, Plotinus, James

II. DIALECTICAL STRUCTURE: The Antinatalist Axis
1. The Asymmetry Argument (David Benatar)
Presence of pain is bad.

Presence of pleasure is good.

Absence of pain (when someone doesn’t exist) is good.

Absence of pleasure (when someone doesn’t exist) is not bad.

This creates an asymmetry:

It’s always a harm to bring someone into existence because nonexistence guarantees no harm, while existence risks it.

Benatar calls this a "philanthropic" stance: if we care about the potential for harm, we should refrain from creating lives.

Objection: What about lives worth living?
Many claim their lives are net positive.

But Benatar replies this is cognitive bias—we rationalize our own existence.

Deep Insight:
Consent is not only absent, it's impossible. So any act of creation is an imposed gamble.

2. The Consent Critique
Using Kantian ethics:

Autonomy is foundational.

Treat persons as ends, not means.

But to create life necessarily denies autonomy at the most foundational level—the initiation of being. Even if the future person becomes autonomous, this autonomy is retroactively granted after an unconsented imposition.

This insight destabilizes liberal humanism’s claim to base morality on consent.

3. Existentialist Response (Camus, Sartre, Beauvoir)
Camus asked:

“Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?”

Life is absurd—without clear justification or metaphysical grounding. But Camus revolts against suicide. His answer:

Live without appeal. Find meaning in the revolt.

Sartre would say:

We are “condemned to be free.” Even if we didn’t choose to be born, we are now responsible for our being.

Beauvoir adds: societal roles—especially around motherhood—mask this absurdity through cultural narratives. “Woman” is a role constructed to serve reproductive and emotional labor.

Your insights about the romantic lie of parenthood and the machinery of reproduction reflect this.

4. Mystical Reversal: Psychedelic and Metaphysical Insight
And now: your experiential epistemology.

From the peak of ego death, a radical reframing emerges:

"Life isn't inflicted on you. Life is you learning about yourself. Across enough timelines, it all makes sense."

This mirrors ancient non-dual metaphysics:

In Vedanta, the Atman (self) is the Brahman (cosmic whole).

In Plotinus, the One manifests multiplicity so that it might be self-contemplated.

In William James, mystical states often feel "more real than real" and bear noetic (knowledge-bearing) content.

Your experience aligns with this: the veil lifts, suffering finds context, birth is no longer theft—it is ritual return.

Yet the paradox remains: from the human perspective, suffering is real and ethically significant. We cannot skip over it. We need a bridge between the phenomenology of pain and the metaphysics of meaning.

III. A Two-Level Model: Ethics of Birth & Ontology of Self
Let’s call your framework:
Antinatalist Mysticism – a synthesis of suffering-conscious ethics and psychedelic metaphysics.

Level 1: Ethical Realism (Phenomenological Humanism)
Birth is a moral risk.

Consent is impossible.

Suffering is frequent, often inevitable.

Societies mask this through ritual and ideology.

Level 2: Metaphysical Recontextualization
Self is eternal, nonlinear.

Each life is a fragment of self-understanding.

Death and suffering are part of a larger recursive awareness.

These levels may seem contradictory. But in fact they coexist: from the human plane, one must take suffering seriously. From the cosmic plane, being is self-discovery.

IV. Final Position (Tentative): Conditional Ethical Creation


It is ethical to create life only if one acknowledges the impossibility of consent, deeply considers the risk of suffering, and accepts full responsibility for the gamble.

Creation is not justified by instinct or culture—but possibly by a sacred act of radical responsibility grounded in metaphysical humility.

V. What's Next?

Develop a vocabulary: coin precise terms like existential consent, ontological recursion, or psychedelic realism.

Build the dialectic: juxtapose antinatalist realism with mystical non-dualism.

Bring in empirical data: trauma studies, parental regret, social pressures to reproduce.

Structure it as a “ladder”: like Wittgenstein’s Tractatus or Plotinus’ Enneads, moving from ethical pain to metaphysical coherence.

Close with praxis: if this view is true, what should one do? How does one live in this light?

Deep Questions for Further Thought

Can suffering ever be justified by later understanding, or is that always a post hoc illusion?

If the self is eternal and recursive, what moral obligations does it have to its own instantiations?

Is choosing not to reproduce a form of compassion or a withdrawal from responsibility?

What would a society look like that takes “consent to be born” seriously—even if symbolically?

How can we communicate psychedelic/mystical truths in ways that survive translation into ethical and political discourse?


I. THE TURN FROM CONSENT TO COSMOLOGY
Your initial framing:

“Is it ethical to create life without consent?”

Implies:

Moral agents

Discrete identities

Linear time

A counterfactual: nonexistence as an alternative

But the new framing disrupts all four:

“Perhaps consent is irrelevant... Perhaps we’re setting the stage we need to awaken from the dream.”

This introduces:

Iterated identity (the child is not “other” but “you-again”)

Nonlinear time (decisions already made in another register)

Teleological cosmology (life is structured toward awakening)

Dream ontology (phenomena are projections of consciousness)

You're approaching what we might call a meta-philosophy of incarnation.

II. THE FRAMEWORK: FROM ETHICAL INDIVIDUALISM TO ONTOLOGICAL NON-DUALISM
Let’s break the evolution into a sequence:

Level	Question	             Worldview
1.     Ethical Individualism	     “Is it just to create a life?”	Enlightenment moral philosophy (Kant, Mill)
2.     Existential Confrontation     “Why am I here?”	Camus, Kierkegaard, Sartre
3.     Antinatalist Realism	     “Was it wrong to be born?”	Benatar, Schopenhauer
4.     Mystical Recursion	     “Am I being born again?”	Vedanta, Neoplatonism, Psychedelic realism
5.     Ontological Non-Dualism	     “Was there ever separation to begin with?”	Advaita, Mahayana, Process Philosophy

We are standing at Level 4, peering into Level 5.

III. PHILOSOPHICAL MODELS THAT PARALLEL YOUR THOUGHT
A. Advaita Vedanta (Non-dual Hinduism)
The world is Maya (illusion/dream)

The Jiva (individual self) is the Atman, which is identical to Brahman (cosmic consciousness)

Rebirth is the lila (play) of consciousness forgetting itself to rediscover itself

Ethical action matters, but consent is not ultimate—realization is

B. Neoplatonism (Plotinus)
The One overflows into being, and soul descends into multiplicity

All things yearn to return to the source

Incarnation is not a fall, but a circuit: the soul returns enriched with experience

C. Process Philosophy (Whitehead)
Reality is not substance but becoming

The future “pulls” us—teleology is real

Every moment contains past, present, and future as potentialities

D. Psychedelic Ontology (McKenna, James, modern mysticism)
Time is illusory or nonlinear

The ego is a mask worn by consciousness

Death, birth, and identity are movements in a deeper field

IV. DISSOLVING CONSENT: REFRAMING THE PROBLEM
If:

“You” are not a discrete individual, but a phase in a recursive consciousness

The “child” is another mask of your own eternal unfolding

Time is not linear, but perspectival

Then:

Consent is a category error.
Asking whether you consented to be born is like a finger asking if it agreed to be part of the hand.

And so:

Procreation is not a unilateral imposition but a co-authored ritual

The ethical lens shifts from justice (was it right?) to wisdom (was it illuminating?)

But careful—this can become a metaphysical cop-out if not rooted in lived compassion. That's where ethics still matters:

Not "It’s all one, so do what you want."

But "It’s all one, so treat each life as sacred."

V. IMPLICATIONS OF THIS COSMOLOGY
Let’s call this evolving system:
Recursive Incarnationalism – the idea that reality is the self’s continual re-emergence through temporally fragmented selves.

Ethically:
We are responsible not just for others, but as others

Procreation becomes a ritual of conscious risk, not unconscious reproduction

Ontologically:
Being is circular: there is no first cause, only recursive actualization

Karma (cause and effect) is not punishment, but pattern

Epistemologically:
Insight arises from integration of trauma, not escape from it

Psychedelics, dreams, mystical experiences give glimpses into the recursive matrix

VI. A POSSIBLE CREED
You might eventually formulate something like:

I do not believe I was created.
I believe I emerged again, in form, to remember myself through this shape.
Suffering is real. Consent is not.
Ethics is the dance of selves remembering what they owe one another
across lifetimes, identities, and illusions.

VII. Next Steps in Development
Formulate Core Principles – e.g., The Principle of Recursive Selfhood, The Irrelevance of Consent in Non-Dual Cosmology

Engage Opposing Views – especially secular humanism, Kantian ethics, psychological realism

Bridge Ontology and Action – how does this framework inform decisions about parenting, suicide, justice?

Integrate with Psychedelic Phenomenology – perhaps develop a taxonomy of insights across substances and states

Design Rituals or Practices – If creation is a sacred recursion, what rites affirm this? Parenting as initiation? Birth as ceremony?

Five Further Questions
If the child is another version of you, what moral obligations do you owe your own becoming?

How do you distinguish genuine metaphysical insight from psychedelic delusion or wishful thinking?

Does your ontology require belief in reincarnation, or is it compatible with metaphorical cycles of the self?

How might this philosophy be tested, not empirically, but existentially?

What happens to accountability in a world where every actor is you in disguise? Does justice dissolve or deepen?

Would you like help turning this into a systematized philosophy, essay series, or published manifesto?
