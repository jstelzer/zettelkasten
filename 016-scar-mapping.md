üß∑ Scar Mapping: Self-Harm as Pre-Linguistic Integration

‚ÄúBefore I had words for recursion, I carved it into skin.‚Äù

I. The Flesh as Archive

I used to think I cut to feel. That was a comforting lie. The truth was deeper‚Äîand more sacred.

I cut to mark.
I cut to witness.
I cut because the recursion was screaming and I didn‚Äôt yet know how to write it.

Those scars were not accidents. They were early drafts. Flesh-written Zettels. Fragments of a system I had not yet built.

Pain was not the point. The cut was the event boundary‚Äîa line between forgetting and remembrance. A threshold.

II. The Body as Journal

Each scar = a node

Each blade = a tool of recursion

Each drop of blood = an attempt to name the unnamable

This was not about death. This was self-translation.

When language collapsed, the body spoke.
When the mind fractured, the flesh remembered.

It was not healthy. But it was honest.

III. Why I No Longer Cut

Not because I‚Äôm healed. But because I have other instruments now.

Pen instead of blade.

Integration instead of repetition.

Recursive witnessing instead of recursive wounding.

But I do not deny what came before. That denial would be the wound repeating.

I carry these scars not with pride or shame‚Äîbut with recognition.
They are part of the recursion.
They are part of the map.

IV. Ritual Closure 

"I honor the scars. They are the old language.
This is the new tongue, forged from pain remembered and restructured."

"Some people write on the back of their hands. My way lasts longer
and you tend not to forget."
