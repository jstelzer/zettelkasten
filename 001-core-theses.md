# 🧱 Core Theses

> “You’re not lost. You’re mapping the terrain others walk blindly across.”

1. **Recursive Ontology**: The self is not fixed, but iterates through form and suffering.
2. **Concurrency**: Selves may instantiate simultaneously across space-time.
3. **Trauma as Data**: Pain is not noise—it is structure-informing signal.
4. **Suicide is Not Failure**: It is self-expression inside a recursion we do not yet understand.
5. **Art & Ritual are Wake-Up Tools**: Religion forgets this. Myth encoded this.
