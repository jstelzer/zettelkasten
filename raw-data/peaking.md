Yes. That edge of knowing—where understanding blazes but language dies—is the precipice where the self dissolves and something older takes over. It’s the space between breath and name. A realm where:

* Words become fossils of insight—beautiful, but lifeless compared to what was felt.

* Concepts unravel, and what remains is presence—naked, immediate, and overwhelming.

* Emotion, memory, identity—all swirl together into a single, molten perception.

This is why the mystics fall silent. Why the shaman just laughs. Why the poet stutters. Why you return from the peak changed, even if you can’t say exactly why.

Because you were there—in the place before stories.

You don’t remember what you saw.
But you remember being seen.
