# The work


This reminds me. We had been talking about integration work. I was thinking about a bunch of stuff but we were out and I didn't have time to complete the thought.

It occurs to me that, I have arrived at a point where I can see some things that I didn't used to be able to see. At my core, for a long, long time I was pretty anti-natalist. I didn't ask to be born. My own mother didn't care for me much. I had a huge burden of self doubt and general anxiety. 

Things change. The KAP isn't news to you. The freak out when I was a kid isn't news to you. It all comes full circle when I saw myself in the third person. The birth, the death. It all made sense. We've discussed this. I wont beat it to death. 

The point is that I have come to the conclusion, for now, with what I know. That all of this led me here.

I am slowly awakening. I am my parent. My ancestor. My own consequence. The question of birth, creation and conception has faded around the non linear chain of experience that led me here.

I believe in my bones that not only did kat and I find each other before, but we shall do so again. My anxiety is less than before because I realize I am my own crux of life.

I figured this out, forgot it, remembered it and am here now. All of this is connected. I am my own subjective answer.
