# GATEWAYS

A Chapter of Return and Rebellion

“No rules or restraints are longer valid / When the ancient future is reclaimed.”
— Dimmu Borgir

## Initiation by Fire

Every system has a doorway. Every psyche, a fault line.

Some doors are gilded with ritual.
Others are kicked open by grief, acid, or accident.
Mine was lit by trauma and backlit by a sheet of LSD I was too young to hold.

There is no one way in—but there is always a cost.

Some call it ego death. Some call it madness. Some call it healing.
I call it a gateway.

Not the kind you walk through and leave behind,
but the kind that reorganizes you from the inside out.


## The First Truth: Everything Hurts

The core principle of freedom is the only notion to obey.
But freedom isn’t the absence of structure—it’s the capacity to make meaning out of collapse.

What they call sin, I call recursion.

What they call failure, I call punctuation.

Pain is not noise. It’s signal.
It teaches the shape of the recursion you are.

“Trauma is not just injury—it is a recursive insight seed.” ￼

We do not suffer for nothing.
We suffer to see.


## The Rebirth Loop

To be born once is biology.
To be born again is recursion.
To be born consciously—that is the work of lifetimes.

“The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber…”

We do not return to purity.
We return to awareness.

What is called enlightenment might be nothing more than the realization
that you have always been here—watching yourself unfold from every angle.

There is no finish line. There is only integration.


## The Keys Were Always in Your Hands

There was never a gatekeeper.

Just a gate.

You were born holding the keys,
but the world taught you to doubt your own hands.

Be the broken or the breaker.
Be the giver or the undertaker.

But either way:
Realize you are your own sole creator.
Of your life.
Your pain.
Your pattern.
Your path.

Not because you chose it—but because you are it.


## The Ancient Future

Recursion is not new.
It is ancient.
And it is yours.

You are the river and the drought.
The hunger and the feast.
The orphan and the one who birthed the orphan.

“No rules or restraints are longer valid
When the ancient future is reclaimed.”

This is not nihilism.
This is radical authorship.

To reclaim your recursion is to burn the false scripts
and write in your own blood and silence.


## What is a Gateway?

A gateway is not a place.

It is a moment of recursion-aware rupture.
It can be:

* A bad trip
	
* A suicide note unsent

* The death of a brother

* A realization mid-ritual
	
* A scream in the hospital light
	
* A flash of déjà vu

* A ketamine breakthrough where the hive mind across eternity winks at you

A gateway is the moment your story folds in on itself
and you realize you’ve been telling it from the other side all along.


## Integration Note to Self

When you find a gateway:

*  Do not worship it.

*  Do not fear it.

*  Walk through it naked.

*  Let it rearrange your myth.

Then write.
Not for others. For your future self.

“Re-read as another version of yourself.” ￼

This is how we leave trails across timelines.
Not to escape the maze—but to map it.


## Final Words: The Only Law

“The core principle of freedom is the only notion to obey.”

Freedom is not given.
It is reclaimed—after every gateway.

And every time you awaken again,
every time you scream back into form,
every time you open your eyes in this dream—

remember:

You are not here by mistake.

You are the key and the lock.

The pain and the portal.

The ancient and the future.

Welcome back.
